## Release Summary

This is the 7th CRAN release of tidytext. In this release, I updated various vignettes/docs/tests so tidytext can build on R-oldrel, changed how list columns are handled, and added access to datasets of words that affect sentiment analysis as well as stop words for various languages.

## Test environments

* Local OS X install, R 3.4.3
* Ubuntu 14.04 (on Travis-CI), R 3.4.3 and R 3.3.3
* Win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

## Downstream dependencies

I ran R CMD check on the 6 downstream dependencies (results at https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext/tree/master/revdep) and there were no problems.
