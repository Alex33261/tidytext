## Release Summary

This is the fifth CRAN release of tidytext. In this release, we converted non-standard evaluation from underscored functions to use the tidyeval framework, implemented tiders for the stm package, added a [pkgdown site](https://juliasilge.github.io/tidytext), and fixed some bugs.

## Test environments
* Local OS X install, R 3.4.1
* Ubuntu 14.04 (on Travis-CI), R 3.4.1
* Win-builder (devel and release)
* r-hub using `check_on_windows()`
